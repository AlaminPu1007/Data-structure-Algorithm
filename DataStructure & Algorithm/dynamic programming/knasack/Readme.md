## Knapsack Problem

The Knapsack problem is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. The objective is to select a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a specified weight limit. There are several variations of the Knapsack problem:

1. `**Fractional Knapsack :**` - In this version, you can take fractions of items. The goal is to maximize the total value of the knapsack, allowing for the possibility of taking any portion of an item.
2. `**0/1 Knapsack: :**` - Here, each item can either be taken or left (i.e., you cannot take a fraction of an item). The objective is to maximize the total value of the selected items while staying within the weight limit.
3. `**Unbounded Knapsack :**` - In this variation, you can take an unlimited number of each type of item. The aim is to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight capacity.

## Type of 0/1 knapsack problem

1. Subset sum
2. Equal sum partition
3. Count of subset sum
4. Minimum subset sum difference
5. Target sum
6. No fo subset sum given difference
