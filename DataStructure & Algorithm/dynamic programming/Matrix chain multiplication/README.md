# Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)

Matrix Chain Multiplication is an algorithm that is used to determine the lowest cost way of multiplying a sequence of matrices. The goal is to find the optimal order in which to multiply the matrices so as to minimize the total number of scalar multiplications. The actual multiplication follows the standard matrix multiplication rules, but the challenge lies in finding the most efficient multiplication sequence.

## Related Topics in MCM

1. **MCM (Matrix Chain Multiplication)**

   - The core problem itself, focused on finding the optimal way to multiply a given chain of matrices with the least number of multiplications.

2. **Printing MCM**

   - Extending the MCM problem to not only find the minimum cost but also to output the optimal parenthesization of the matrices.

3. **Evaluate Expression to True/Boolean Parenthesizations**

   - Given a boolean expression, find the number of ways to parenthesize the expression so that it evaluates to true. This problem is similar in structure to MCM.

4. **Min/Max Value of an Expression**

   - For a given mathematical expression, find the minimum or maximum value by changing the order of operations through different parenthesizations.

5. **Palindrome Partitioning**

   - Partition a given string such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. The goal is to minimize the number of cuts needed.

6. **Scramble String**

   - Determine if one string is a scramble of another string. This involves checking if one string can be transformed into another through a series of recursive splitting and swapping operations.

7. **Egg Dropping Problem**

   - A problem that involves finding the minimum number of attempts needed to find the critical floor from which an egg will break when dropped, using a given number of eggs and floors.

These topics are interconnected through their reliance on dynamic programming and recursive strategies to solve problems involving optimal partitioning, parenthesization, and order of operations.
