## The purposes of using disjoint data-structure

The purpose of a disjoint-set data structure, also known as a union-find data structure, is to efficiently manage a collection of disjoint sets. It provides operations to merge sets and determine whether two elements belong to the same set.<br />

By using efficient data structures and optimizations, such as path compression and union by rank, the disjoint-set data structure achieves near-constant time complexity for its operations, making it a valuable tool in various algorithms and applications.<br />
